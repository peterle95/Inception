1. Check that the configurations files for nginx and wordpress are correct
--> https://medium.com/@ssterdev/inception-guide-42-project-part-i-7e3af15eb671

Next step will be to configure nginx and php so that they can communicate.
We would need to copy the default server configuration file from the nginx container and the default config for the php service and make some minor modifications to it.

Default config for PHP location: /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
Default config for NGINX location: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
While still having our containers running, we can open another terminal and copy these files from inside our containers using the command docker cp.

docker cp wp-php:/etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf ./requirements/wordpress/.
docker cp nginx:/etc/nginx/sites-available/default ./requirements/nginx/.

For the php default configuration file “www.conf” we only need to change a 
single line (line 41). Instead of listening to the default “/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock address,
 we need to tell php that it needs to accept FastCGI request from address “wp-php:9000”, 
 the localhost of our wordpress-php container at port 9000.

 2. Check also that the mariadb conf file is fine
-> https://medium.com/@ssterdev/inception-42-project-part-ii-19a06962cf3b

3. Custom website not generic website, change the script to display a basic webpage

4. Check how to test database

5.4. mariaDB check
Open another terminal and keep the terminal with the compose running. On this other terminal, run the following command to enter in the mariadb container.

docker exec -it mariadb /bin/bash
Then run the command to enter in the mysql

mysql -u your_user -p db_name 
Then run the command to see the tables

SHOW TABLES;
If you see the tables, it means that all is ok. If you want to see the database, run the following command:

SELECT * FROM table_name\G;
And if you want to delete a row in a table, run the following command:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name = some_value;
After that, you can exit the mysql and the container and all your project work is done. Congratulations!

6. Example for static and dynamic file for NGINX

7. Check the URL when logging in with normal user

8. Check that nginx is only using TLSv1.3
-> openssl s_client -connect pmolzer.42.fr:443 -tls1_3
**Expected:**
- Command should succeed and show the certificate.

-> openssl s_client -connect pmolzer.42.fr:443 -tls1
**Expected:**
- Command should fail with a handshake error.
